Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000:
Although Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 are not supported in 
an official capacity, Baldur's Gate II can be run correctly 
under Windows NT 4.0 if the following conditions are met: You 
will need at least 64 MB of RAM and must have NT 4.0 Service 
Pack 3 installed.  If you wish to run multiplayer, then Service
Pack 4 is required.  Slow downs during gameplay have been 
reported under NT.  These are due to the way that Direct Sound
and the System Timers interact.  This may be corrected in 
future versions of Windows NT.  We have done moderate testing
under Windows 2000 and Baldur's Gate II does generally work 
correctly.  The primary compatibility issues involve 
driver support - check to make sure that you are always
using the most recent drivers for your hardware.  In general,
Baldur's Gate II works very well in Windows 2000.

Windows Millennium
During development we have had limited opportunity to test
Baldur's Gate II fully under Windows Millennium since its 
commercial availability will happen after Baldur's Gate II has
been released.  In spite of this we have made our best efforts
to make sure Baldur's Gate II is compatible with Windows 
Millennium.  We have been able to test the game with early release
copies of Windows Millennium and found that it works well.  
We will quickly address any problems that do arise with 
compatibility between Windows Millennium and Baldur's Gate 
II, if any.

Higher Resolutions
Baldur's Gate II has the capability to support resolutions
beyond the standard 800x600.  Please note that these
resolutions are not officially supported, but they do 
function well enough to play if you choose to do so.  There
are two methods possible to set an increased resolution.
You can open the Baldur.ini file with a standard text viewer, 
such as Notepad, and find the line entitled Resolution.  
You can manually change the resolution to 1024 
(for 1024x768), 1280 (for 1280x1024), 1600 (for 1600x1200) 
and to 2048 (for 2048x1600).  Or, you can unlock the special 
section of the Graphics Selection of the BG Config program and 
set the new resolution inside the config.  The added 
benefit of this method is that BG Config will test the 
mode to see if it is available on your computer.  Again we 
recommend against choosing these unsupported resolutions 
unless you have a very powerful system featuring a high 
memory video card.  Problems you will see in unsupported 
high resolutions include slowdowns and in-game cut scene 
abnormalities. 


1b.  Installation

Insert the CD-ROM labeled Baldur's Gate II Disc 1 into your 
CD-ROM drive and follow the onscreen instructions.  If your CD
Autorun is disabled, find the Baldur.exe application in the 
root of the CD labeled Disc 1 and double click to launch the 
Installer.

After installing Baldur's Gate II, you will have the option 
to install DirectX 7.0.  If you do not have DirectX 7.0 or
higher, you must install it.  Baldur's Gate 2 requires 
DirectX 7 or greater to play the game.

Future versions of DirectX might have driver updates which 
will make Baldur's Gate II run better on your system.  However,
Baldur's Gate II only requires DirectX 7.0.

Compact install versus recommended install:
A compact install represents the base information required to 
be on the hard drive to play. A recommended install includes 
more information than a compact install, resulting in smoother
performance.  For example, some character voices and monster 
animations are stored on the hard drive in a recommended install, 
which speeds up game performance.  You must leave the CD 
in the drive at all times when playing with a compact install.
You may have to reinsert CD's at times with a recommended install, 
but this should be less frequent than in the minimum install.

Note on Full Installations:
Windows 95 does not correctly report the free space on hard 
drive partitions larger that 2 Gigs.  Because of this, you may
get an "insufficient disk space" error if you decide to 
install everything from the CDs in Windows 95, even if you do 
have the disk space available.  To bypass this, just choose to
"install anyway" when you receive this error and installation 
will proceed correctly.  This problem does not occur with 
Windows 98.

A full install will only require a CD to be in the drive when
you start the game (for anti-piracy purposes).

1c.  Registering Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn with Black 
     Isle Studios

Please take a few moments to fill out the Electronic 
Registration for Baldur's Gate II.  Your feedback will make 
you eligible for special offers and promotions, and it also 
provides us with information we need in order to make better 
games.  We'd appreciate your time. 

Please note that to electronically register you will need
both an internet connection and a browser installed.  If you
lack either, you will not be able to register BG2 
electronically.


1d.  Running Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

If you use the default installation settings for Baldur's Gate II,
it will be installed in a 'Black Isle' Program Group in your Start 
menu.  You can edit this start menu location during installation
if you so choose.


1e.  Configuration Set-Up: Baldur's Gate II Config (BGConfig)

One program of note in your game directory is the Baldur's 
Gate II Config utility.  This application will allow you to 
assign various hotkeys for the game, as well as set 
performance options.  BGConfig.exe can be found on the 
Autorun Menu, within the Black Isle\BGII-SOA program group 
on the Start Menu and in the Baldur's Gate II root directory.

Once executed, the BGConfig program presents the user with 
five areas of choice:

You are first presented with a choice of difficulty level.
You must make a choice to proceed - there is accompanying text
that explains the different levels.

The Basic Configuration tab allows users to quickly match the 
capabilities of their system with our recommended performance 
levels and features.  It consists of a number of sliders that
can be manipulated.  It also allows you to set the difficulty
level of your game - please note the difficulty can be modified 
while you play the game in the Gameplay portion of the Options 
screen.  You also can make the choice for 3D support on this 
page.

The Hotkeys option allows you to set various Key Configurations
for Baldur's Gate II.  Information on Hotkeys is found in section
2.0, "How to play the game."

The Gameplay options allow you to change a number of advanced
features of the game - these features are also modified by the
sliders in the Basic Configuration section.  It is advisable
to modify these options only if you are an advanced user.  

The Graphics Configuration tab contains more details on system
configuration including details regarding 3D support.  There is
extensive documentation available in this section to help the
more sophisticated user work through the various detailed 
configuration options.  Accompanying Baldur's Gate 2 is a 
document entitled powerusers.txt that discusses many of the
advanced features of the game.

Baldur's Gate II uses OpenGL for its 3D hardware acceleration.  
You can choose to use 3D support in the basic configuration menu,
but to modify specific 3D features you should check the Graphics 
tab.  


1f.  Baldur's Gate II Web Page

If you continue to have problems, stop by the Baldur's Gate II
Web Page at http://www.interplay.com/bgate2.  Aside from cool
game materials, you may be able to find an answer for whatever
question you might have on the Baldur's Gate II message boards.
People from both BioWare and Black Isle frequent the boards,
providing advice and assistance to users.


------------------------------------------------
2. How to Play the Game and Advanced Information
------------------------------------------------

The mouse is the tool primarily used to maneuver through the 
interfaces in Baldur's Gate II. Placing your mouse over a 
button or item will bring up a tool tip describing the item's 
name or the button's function.

Below is a list of default hotkey commands that can be used 
as shortcuts in Baldur's Gate II.  Of note are the "Hide 
Interface" keys.  BG 2's features include the ability to 
modify the game-world graphical user interface (GUI) 
arrangement.  Side panels, and even the lower panel can be 
removed, depending on your preference.  Here are the default
hotkeys:


Pause Game (very important!)=space bar
Back one level in interface=ESC
Inventory=I
Character Record=R
Return To Game=G
Journal=J
Map=M
Wizard/Sorcerer Spells=W
Priest/Druid Spells=P
Options=O
Hide/Unhide Entire Interface=H
Hide/Unhide Right Interface=U
Hide/Unhide Left Interface=Y  
Chat Window=T (multiplayer only)
Location=X (gives X,Y coordinates of the particular area your
           party is in)
Quick Save=Q
Toggle party AI on/off=A

You can modify these key bindings using the Hotkeys tab in
BGConfig.

Quick Save:     

At any time during play you can press 'Q' on the keyboard to 
save the game. This 'quick' save is always saved in the same 
slot and will overwrite itself. Using the Quick Save will not 
touch any of your other save games.  You can also enable a 
Quick Load key in the config program to load your quick saves
if you so choose (this is off by default).
 
Party Order:

To change the order of the characters in your party, drag and 
drop their character portraits to exchange them in the party 
order.  For example, to switch the order of "Char1" and 
"Char2," left click on Char1, continue to hold down the mouse 
button and move the cursor over the portrait of Char2.  
Release the mouse button and Char1 and Char2 will change 
places.

Items in the Game World:

If you leave items on the ground in the game world, they will 
disappear after a period of time (with a few special items as 
exceptions).  Bodies will begin to decay from the world after 
about half a day.  Items will begin to decay from the world 
after a day or two.  Some game critical items will never decay.

If you want to stash items, put them inside any container. For
example; a chest, bookshelf, or box.  All container contents
(with the exceptions of piles of treasure on the ground) are 
saved for the duration of the game - just be sure you can 
easily return to retrieve your favorite goodies.

Custom Portraits:

The measurements for player portraits are 38X60 pixels for 
the smaller portraits (8-bit color runs faster but it can be 
up to 24 bit color), and 110X170 pixels for the larger 
portraits.  To use a custom portrait, place it in the 
Portraits directory (in the install  directory for the game) 
and add an S to the end of the small portrait name and an L 
to the end of the  large portrait - otherwise the two names
must be identical.  The names must be 1-7 letters long, 
maximum - so the filename with the S or L added to the end 
is no longer than 8 total characters.  The portrait files 
must be in BMP format.

For example:
XXXXXXXS.bmp for small (38x60, 8-bit)
XXXXXXXL.bmp for large (110x170, 24-bit)

For multiplayer, each player must have a copy of the 
portraits, otherwise they will see a blank icon instead of 
the other player's custom portraits.  You will need to 
manually send these portraits to your friends as BG2 has
no method of transferring them.
        
Custom Sound files:

The following is a list of the WAV files for the custom 
sound sets. The list has been increased and modified since 
Baldur's Gate, so if you already have a custom sound set you 
will need to update it to match the current format. Replace 
each 'XXXXXXX' in the filenames with the name of the sound 
set (MAX 7 CHARACTERS in XXXXXXX, plus one character as noted
below for a total of 8 letters).  All the WAV files should be
22 khz, 16 bit mono sounds.  

Copy the WAV files to the Sounds directory located in the 
directory that Baldur's Gate II was installed in, and then 
select this sound set either in character creation or in the 
"Customize" button off of the Character Record page.  For 
multiplayer, merely send your custom sounds to all of the 
people you are playing with and have them copy them to the 
Sounds directory. If you have installed the sounds to your 
character in your game, everyone will hear your sounds once 
they copy them into the correct directory.

IMPORTING CHARACTERS AND SAVED GAMES
In Baldur’s Gate II you are able to import characters and 
saved games from Baldur’s Gate or from the expansion pack, 
Baldur’s Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast. Even if you have 
uninstalled Baldur’s Gate 1, you will still be able to access 
your old save games and characters, UNLESS you have manually 
deleted these files. There will also be pre-made characters
that you can use if you do not want to go through character 
generation. These represent a broad selection of popular 
character types that the newcomer to the genre will enjoy 
playing.

Characters can be imported using either of the following 
methods: 1) by extracting characters from an existing save game 
OR 2) by importing the character files (CHR files) directly.
 
To import a character from a saved game (either from Baldur's 
Gate, Tales of the Sword Coast, or Baldur's Gate II) copy 
the save directory into the directory entitled SAVE in the Baldur's 
Gate II root directory.  Then, begin Baldur's Gate II, start a 
new game, choose the import option at the bottom of the screen 
and follow the instructions.

To import a character from a character file (either from Baldur's 
Gate, Tales of the Sword Coast, or Baldur's Gate II) copy the 
character file (xxxxxxxx.CHR) into the directory entitled 
CHARACTERS in the Baldur's Gate II root directory.  Then, begin 
Baldur's Gate II, start a new game, choose the import option at 
the bottom of the character generation screen and follow the 
instructions.

Importing a character that uses a custom portrait requires 
that you either choose a portrait from among the existing
portraits or re-import your custom portrait by placing the
portraits in the directory entitled PORTRAITS found in the 
root directory of Baldur's Gate2.  After you've chosen a 
portrait hit DONE to continue the character selection.

You can import hacked characters into Baldur's Gate 2,
however their experience will be capped to the maximum possible 
gained from Tales of the Sword coast. 


Modal actions for characters:

If your AI button is turned ON you may notice your character's
modal abilities turn OFF occasionally.  Modal abilities are 
those abilities that you can turn on and leave on (e.g. 
thieves' detect traps mode).  These modes can be turned off 
when a script action occurs for that character.  If this is 
causing problems for you, you can either select "None" as the 
script for your character or click the "AI on/off" button (on 
the main game screen at the lower right to the left of the 
select all button) to toggle this.

BG2 Script Compiler

Baldur's Gate 2 ships with a Script Compiler, this is a BETA
quality program that advanced users can try out to enhance their
BG2 experience.  The program, along with documentation, is
installed to the Hard Drive in a directory called Scriptcompile.

The To-Hit Roll:

If you have turned on 'To-Hit Rolls' in your Feedback 
settings, the game will display the rolls on each attack. The 
roll will display:
	
X + Y = Z
    
Where	
X = base to hit roll (1-20)
Y = any bonuses/penalties to hit
Z = total to hit roll
    
Y is the total aggregate value of all bonuses and/or penalties
that are applied to the character's to hit roll.  This value 
is also usually reflected in the difference between the 
character's THACO and base THACO on the character page.  
However, certain bonuses or penalties will show in the value Y 
that don't show on the THACOs on the Character Record, such as 
off handed attack penalties.  Also - weapon versus armor type
bonuses and penalties are also applied to Y.

Reading dialogue stored in the buffer:
    
In many cases, you may want to scroll up through the dialogue 
in the text window.  If you find that game messages are 
interfering with this (the window will reset to display new 
messages), hold down the left mouse button while using the 
slider.  While the left mouse button is depressed, you 
will not be returned to view the new messages.  Alternatively, 
pause the game with the space bar or by clicking on the clock at
the lower left - new messages will not appear while the game is 
paused.
    
Dual Classing - Required Attributes:
 
When you dual class a character, you must possess the 
attributes required to be able to dual class to that new 
class.  If you do not see the class that you wish to dual 
class to in the available classes (i.e., it is dimmed out), 
then this means that your character does not possess the 
required attribute(s) for that class.  However, any classes to
which the character CAN dual class WILL always be displayed as
available.

Pre-order content pack information:

Part of the promotional program for Baldur's Gate II included 
the distribution of specialized game content packages with 
specific retailers for special customers that pre-ordered 
Baldur's Gate II.  These packages contain additional game items
that can be purchased in certain stores within the game world.
Note: These items are NOT required for completing the game and
there are equivalently powerful items available in the rest of 
the game - the items that are added in the presell CD's are
however, interesting and different items to try out.

During multiplayer games, the items available in these content 
packs will be available to players ONLY if the content pack 
is installed on the server, in which case all players will 
have access to the items.  If one of the clients has the pack
and the server does not, the client will not be able to 
purchase the special items.

Character Viewer (CharView.exe):

Provided with Baldur's Gate II is a Character Viewer utility
created at BioWare for reviewing character statistics and 
printing character record sheets.  The Character Viewer can be
found in the root of your install directory.

You can use the Character Viewer to load an exported CHR
file (you can export your main character from the in-game
character record with the Export command).  (The character
viewer is NOT able to extract characters from save game 
files).  Under the File heading, use the Open command to
choose a character to view.  

The character viewer does not allow modification or saving 
of the character data to another character file.  
Nor does it allow you to identify items in your inventory 
that are currently unidentified.

How to Use:
1. While playing Baldur’s Gate II, go to the Record Screen
2. Select your character from the list on the right, if your 
character’s info is not showing.
3. Click on the "Export" button.
4. You will be asked for an exported character filename.  
Type one in and click on "Done".  Your character will be exported 
to the "Characters" subdirectory of Baldur’s Gate II with 
the extension ".CHR".
5. Exit the Baldur’s GateII program.
6. Run charview.exe from the same directory as Baldur’s Gate II.
7. Select Open from the File menu, and choose a character to view.
8. You can now look at the character’s statistics.  
For a printed out character sheet, select Print from the File menu.  
To create a text file of the character information which you 
can use to create your own character sheet, select 
"Save As" from the "File" menu.

Please note that the Baldur's Gate II Character Viewer 
does not officially support character files from the 
original Baldur's Gate game or Tales of the Sword Coast 
expansion pack.  If you wish to use the Baldur's Gate II 
Character Viewer with character files from those products, 
please import them into Baldur's Gate II and then 
re-export them.  You can then load the character files 
into the Character Viewer as described above.

Miscellaneous:

There is a Wizards of the Coast character creation utility
that is on the first CD in the WOTCchvr directory.
This utility is optional and allows you to check out 
third edition AD&D characters if you so choose.

Using Items in BG2:

Rechargeable vs. Limited Use items

A rechargeable item will recharge after a rest.  The ring of 
invisibility, for example, has one charge per day (i.e. one 
rest).  After using it for the day the item will be drained.  
Resting will restore functionality to the item.
 
Certain items such as wands are created with a limited number 
of charges.  When these items run out of charges the item is 
destroyed.  For example, a mage finds a wand of fireballs 
(with one charge remaining) and uses it against a horde of 
rampaging kobolds.  After the fireball is fired the wand will 
be destroyed.  

Rechargeable Item types

Quickslot Items: These items appear in the quickslots on the 
mainscreen GUI.  These are items that can’t be placed into 
any of the other inventory slots, such as ring, boot or weapon 
slots.  

If an item is placed in a quickslot and does not have any 
charges remaining for the day it will not appear on the main 
screen toolbar, although it will appear on the inventory page. 
If an item in a quickslot has only one charge remaining and is 
then used the item's icon will fade from the main screen 
toolbar (but the item will remain visible on the inventory 
page).  This is just to demonstrate that the item no longer 
has any uses for the day. 

If a drained item is placed in a quick-slot, the icon will 
appear on the main screen toolbar but disappear if an attempt 
is made to use it. 

* Example: A bard uses his Horn of Blasting (which had only 
one charge remaining).  The icon would then disappear from 
the main screen toolbar, but still be visible in the 
inventory page quickslot.  After resting it would become 
useable again. 

Use Items:  The abilities of these items are accessed through 
the belt-pouch icon on the main screen toolbar.   These are 
items that can be placed in an existing inventory slot 
(boot, helmet, weapon).

Clicking on the belt-pouch icon on the main screen toolbar 
will give a player access to all of the abilities made 
available through his character’s equipped items.  These 
ability icons will have their charges listed in the bottom 
left corner.  When there are no charges left, the icon 
remains, but any attempt to use the item gives the message 
'Item Drained'.

* Example: The ring of invisibility has one charge per day.  
When a player goes to use it, the item icon will display 1 
charge.  After using the ring it will have no more charges 
for the day.  Clicking on it again will result in the 
message 'Item Drained'

 
2a.  Design Notes

* NPCs are sometimes removed from the game world.
NPCs in the game often need to become inactive to preserve the 
integrity of the storyline.  These characters will attempt to 
leave the current area they are in via an exit.  If they 
cannot find one or are blocked, we remove them from the map and
they effectively vanish.  This is not a bug - just how we have 
dealt with the need to remove them.
   
* Magic Resistance
Magic Resistance affects only hostile spells and magic directed
toward your character.  A character with magic resistance will
have a chance of resisting hostile magical attacks, but he or 
she will always be affected by positive magics cast by party
members such as healing spells.  Note, this is very different 
from the way magic resistance behaved in the original
Baldur's Gate.

  * Spells not affecting Party Members and Neutrals
Several spells are completely ineffective against party members
or neutral characters.  Examples of these spells include Sleep,
and Hold Person.   These spells do not affect neutral or 
friendly characters because they are area affect spells.  In
testing, we found it was extremely frustrating when the spells 
affected the party accidentally.  In order to make these spells
worthwhile, we have made them only affect hostile characters.
   
* NPCs initiating dialogue with Invisible/"in shadows" 
characters.  You will find that some NPCs in the game will 
initiate dialogue when you should not be seen by them.  In 
order to ensure that the player receives all critical game 
dialogue, all game critical dialogue will be received.  Also 
note however that a number of high level creatures have the 
ability to see hidden or invisible creatures.
   
* Unjoined NPCs not worth XP.
NPCs who can join your party are not worth XP if killed.  
This is not a bug.
   
* Items transferred to the ground.
If your character's inventory is full, and an NPC gives you an item, 
you will receive a message about the party receiving an item, 
and your character will say that an item has been dropped.  The
item given to you will appear in your inventory, while the first
item in your inventory slot will be dropped on the ground at 
the feet of the player character that received the item.
   
*Pausing during inventory
Please note that in Baldur's Gate II we have chosen to have all
Interface Screens (for example the Journal Page and Character 
Record) pause the action in the game world when they are accessed,
including the Inventory Screen.  This is a departure from Baldur's
Gate, but it was necessary for a number of reasons, both game 
play and technical.  However, to balance AD&D rules, we do NOT allow
PC's to change armor if you are 'in combat'.  (You are considered 
'in combat' if hostile characters are nearby -- this is the same way
we determine whether you can save the game or not).

*Proficiencies and Dual Wielding
Please note that bonus attacks gained from high weapon
proficiencies will only affect the weapon in the character's
right hand.

* Quick Weapon Switching Problems
If you use Range scripts with AI activated for your characters,
there is an instance where problems might occur.  When you run
out of ammunition for your missile weapon and enter melee 
combat, your character will choose his or her most powerful 
melee weapon.  This may cause your character to  change from 
one melee weapon to another under certain  circumstances.  
The most powerful melee weapon is the one delivering the most 
damage - note this might not be the one you would prefer to use
in all cases as it doesn't consider certain magical effects.
You can always choose a new weapon by clicking on the quick
weapon icon you want to use.

4. TroubleShooting
------------------

4a.  Tweaking Performance

Increasing Performance:

Translucent Shadows.  In the options menu under 'Graphics', 
turn off translucent shadows.  Turning this off will cause all
shadows to appear solid, rather than blending a dark shadow 
onto the background which will be faster.
   
Character Movement Sounds.  In the options menu under 
'Sound/Character Sound', turn off Character Movement Sounds.
Turning off this option will increase the speed of the game.
   
Other Audio.  Turning off any of the audio may result in a 
performance increase.  Moving the sliders in the options menu
under 'Sound' all the way to the left will completely disable
the playing of these sounds and should increase gameplay speed.
For slower machines this can be a good compromise in order to 
maintain framerate.
   
Virtual Memory.  
Note: WE DO NOT RECOMMEND ADJUSTING YOUR VIRTUAL MEMORY unless
you fully understand how virtual memory affects your computer.
Baldur's Gate II will eagerly use up any Virtual 
Memory (hard drive) and non-Virtual Memory (RAM) you allocate
to it.  If you choose to add more memory to your system, or 
increase the size of your Windows swap file, the game speed 
MAY increase.  However, as you increase your Virtual Memory, 
expect longer clearing times to remove this 'Virtual Memory' 
from the hard drive after the game is terminated.

Things that will Decrease Performance:

Brightness/Contrast.  Adjusting the default settings for 
these options (located in the options menu under 'Graphics') 
will result in a performance hit.  If you find the game is too
dark, we suggest adjusting your monitors brightness first, and
adjusting the brightness slider second.
   
DirectX Hardware Calls.  In the options menu under 'Graphics' 
there are three toggles for various 'BLTS'.  Enabling these 
will result in a (sometimes drastic) performance hit.  We 
recommend enabling these only if you have graphics glitches 
that you have been unable to resolve.  Sometimes turning one of
these settings on can actually IMPROVE performance - this usually
occurs only if your video card drivers are not 100% DirectX 
compliant.  You can check if your video card drivers are DirectX 
compliant by running the DirectX Diagnostic tool (DXDiag) that 
should be installed by the Microsoft installer for DirectX when 
you install DirectX.
   
Running the game in Windowed Mode.  Running the game in a 
Window on your desktop will decrease the overall game 
performance.

Pathing Performance:

To increase the path searching AI, the following entry can 
either be directly modified in the baldur.ini file that is 
installed in the root of the installation directory, or changed
using the configuration program:

[Program Options]
Path Search Nodes=4000

To increase or decrease the AI, vary the number of Nodes 
(4000 above).  The range can vary from 4000 to 400,000.  
Increasing the number above will increase the number of nodes
in path searching with the possibility slowing down the 
functioning of the game.  Increasing the number of search 
nodes can significantly improve pathfinding.

We have also added an enhanced pathfinding option that, when
activated, improved pathing, but at a performance cost.  We
recommend you only turn on enhanced pathfinding if you have
an above average machine.

Matrox G400 
If you are using this card, having Dual-Head enabled will
slow down the game considerably.  We suggest disabling this
while playing Baldur's Gate II.

Hard Drive Defragmentation
You should regularly defragment your hard drive, as 
fragmentation can result in poor performance.


4b.  Known Problems

* Graphic Errors
Some video cards may experience graphics glitches while 
playing the game.  These problems are caused by DirectX 
Hardware Calls to your video card that are not functioning.  
We have written software renderers for all of these calls to 
allow people to play even with drivers that are not 100% 
compatible with the DirectX standards.  You can enable a 
software render for these calls if you have the most recent 
drivers for your video card and are still experiencing 
problems.  Using the software render will probably fix the 
graphic  glitches, but it WILL result in a performance hit.

IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS WITH THE GRAPHICAL DISPLAY 
OF BALDUR'S GATE II, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE LATEST 
VERSION OF YOUR VIDEO DRIVERS.  DRIVER UPDATES ARE AVAILABLE 
AT MOST (if not all) HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS AND CHIPSET 
MANUFACTURERS SITES ON THE INTERNET.

You may also try installing DirectX 7.0+ if you are 
experiencing graphical problems.

If you have the most recent drivers for your video card, 
and you are still experiencing problems, you can enable 
software renders for these calls. The options are available 
in the options menu under 'Graphics'.  The following list 
describes the known graphics glitches and which Call should 
be disabled to fix them.  If in doubt, try different 
combinations and this may help.  You can always turn off all 
software renders to return to the default settings.

* Minimizing Baldur's Gate II
If you minimize Baldur's Gate II using either Alt-Enter or 
Alt-Tab (and then bring it back up by left clicking on the 
minimized application), the sound effects for the game will 
stutter, loop, and skip.  This is caused by a lack of resources
available to Baldur's Gate II after you go from full screen 
to a minimized screen, and it will correct itself after a 
short period of time.  If you minimize Baldur's Gate II and 
then bring it back up, the game may run more slowly for a time.
This is caused by the game re-accessing resources that become 
tied up by minimization.  Running the game in a window may 
result in lower performance overall.
   
* NT 4.0: Screen-Saver
While running under Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3, we 
have experienced intermittent problems with Screen Savers.  
We recommend disabling your Screen Saver while playing 
Baldur's Gate II.

* Taskbar problems
If you find the Windows taskbar is sitting on top of Baldur's
Gate 2 (note: this is a very rare problem), access the Windows 
Start menu Settings section, and choose the Taskbar option.  In 
the Taskbar menu check the Autohide choice, and make sure the 
Always on Top choice is not selected.  This will eliminate any 
Taskbar problems that exist.

* SoundBlaster Live Overlay Bar
As above, the SoundBlaster Live overlay bar can sometimes 
interfere with Baldur's Gate 2 - turn if off prior to beginning
the game by choosing the "EXIT" option from the leftmost menu
on the bar.


4c.  3D Compatibility

Baldur's Gate II uses 3D cards for enhanced graphics 
capability.  BG2 does not require 3D acceleration but
the 3D graphics enhance the gameplay experience.  To access
the 3D graphic capability of BG2 click the 3D option box on 
the Basic menu in the BGconfig program.  Access the 
Advanced menu for additional 3D options.  

Baldur's Gate II uses OpenGL for its acceleration.  Included
with Baldur's Gate II is GLSetup, a program that ensures
your computer has the most recent OpenGL drivers.  Run this
program by pressing the 3D Setup button next to the Use 3D
Acceleration tag.  This will start GLSetup - follow the 
included instructions.

If you are using any 3dfx card from the Voodoo family, after
checking the 3D checkbox from the Basic tab in the BG Config
program you will need to click on the Graphics tab.  In the 
graphics submenu change the video driver from Default OpenGL 
to 3dfx OpenGL, and make sure that you have turned off 32 Bit 
textures.

If you have any problem with 3D support and Baldur's Gate
II we recommend you turn off 3D acceleration; the game works
just fine without it.  

Known Issues

Known Graphics Issues:

This section describes results of our compatibility testing, 
and advises you on the correct choice of modes and fixes for 
various video cards.

General Workarounds:

With some of the driver issues that were encountered there 
are two general workarounds for most graphical glitches.

4d.  Multiplayer

Baldur's Gate 2 has enhanced multiplayer support in comparison
to the original Baldur's Gate.  We have spent significant time
improving the overall gameplay experience and strongly encourage
users to give it a try.

Here are a few of the things you should be aware of if you are
attempting to play a multiplayer game of Baldur's Gate 2:

  - You must install either a Recommended or Full Install to
    play in multiplayer mode.
  - If you are finding slow load times you should increase you
    cache size to the largest possible size you can fit on your
    hard drive - this will cause areas to be stored on the hard
    drive when possible rather than always loading them off CD.
    You will need a minimum of 300 MB for cache for multiplayer.
  - Make sure your game options such as AI updates and Framerates
    are identical on all systems in the game.  Baldur's Gate 2
    should not allow you to play without synchronization of these
    elements, but it is easier to synchronize them prior to a game.
  - If you are having performance problems during multiplayer 
    review your configuration using the BG Config program.  
    Multiplayer games put additional stress on performance and 
    thus you might need to alter your configuration settings.

Multiplayer Using a Proxy Server

When playing Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn through a proxy 
server, you have only two options: you can have all players behind 
the proxy server, or you can have one person behind the proxy 
server with the other players outside the proxy server. 

You must also set up the proxy server to work with the Direct 
X networking protocol. Make sure you have the ports 2300-2400 
and 47624 set up on the server for both "inbound" and "outbound" 
messages on both "TCP" and "UDP" protocols.

Miscellaneous Multiplayer Issues:

(Rare bug) Occasionally a resurrected character will no 
longer have a green circle underneath nor be able to 
explore new terrain for players other than the player who is
controlling that character.  Saving the game and reloading, 
exiting to a new area, or exporting/reimporting that character
have always fixed this problem when it occurred in testing 
(unknown cause, very rare).
